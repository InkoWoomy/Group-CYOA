// We made a short text adventure with multiple endings

// 10/17/2024: We finished the start page and the first page for everypath
// 10/18/2024: We finished everything else
// 10/18/2024: removed stray Lorem

// Peer reviewed by: Bowen Henry: Remove lorem from that one page. Besides that your endings are very entertaining. It's definitely better than my halloween project. Your code looks good too with your styles being organized. Some of the sites don't fit my screen's resolution very well, but I think we'll figure that out later. Other than that, great job!
